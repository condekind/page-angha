        <p>
          The goal of the Angha Project is to generate C benchmarks out of open
          source repositories. To this end, we download programs from these
          repositories, split them into individual functions and reconstruct
          missing declarations to ensure that they compile. This page contains
          over 1 million samples of programs generated that way. You can
          compile them all into object files using clang or gcc. Additionally,
          we provide all the machinery for those interested in producing
          more benchmarks. For comparison, we also provide actual C benchmarks,
          and synthetic programs produced by various benchmark generators. We
          have extracted feature vectors (59 different features) for all these
          benchmarks, in case the interested reader wants to use them to
          autotune compilers. The figure below illustrates the pipeline of the
          project.
